# Password Strength Assessment Tool

This Python tool assesses the strength of passwords based on their length, complexity, and uniqueness. It provides feedback on whether a password is very weak, weak, moderate, strong, or very strong.

## Features

- **Length Check**: Evaluates the length of the password.
- **Complexity Check**: Assesses the presence of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, and special characters.
- **Uniqueness Check**: Compares the password against a list of common passwords to avoid easily guessable passwords.
- **Feedback**: Provides a strength rating based on the analysis.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Installation
- **Clone the Repository**: https://github.com/gourabg2000/Codtech_Task_1.git

## Usage
- Open the password_strength.py file in your preferred Python IDE or editor (e.g., Spyder).

- Run the script. If using Spyder, click the green Run button or press F5.

- When prompted, enter the password you want to assess.

- The script will output the strength of the password.

## Customization
- **Common Passwords List**: You can expand or modify the common_passwords set in the code to include more commonly used passwords.
- **Strength Metrics**: Adjust the strength metrics and feedback thresholds according to your requirements.
